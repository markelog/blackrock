The Blackrock clan is a prominent orcish clan originally hailing from
the caverns of Gorgrond. On Draenor, they were known for their strict
military discipline and skills in mining and blacksmithing. One of the
first orcish clans to be taught the ways of fel magic, the Blackrocks
were the strongest faction within the Old Horde during the course of
the First and Second Wars, and the Horde's first two Warchiefs —
Blackhand and his deposer Orgrim Doomhammer — were both Blackrocks.
