Dal'rend Blackhand, (or Dal'Rend) commonly known as Rend, was
the ruler of the Dark Horde and was considered to be a great threat to
Thrall's mastery of the Horde when he was Warchief. Rend is the
bloodthirsty son of the former Warchief of the Horde, Blackhand the
Destroyer. He believed that he was the rightful Warchief of the Horde
due to lineage, and sought to overthrow Thrall. To this end, he allied
the forces of the Dark Horde with Nefarian. The two used their
combined resources to re-create the chromatic dragonflight, which they
hoped to unleash upon the world once again. His mount was a massive
chromatic drake named Gyth.
